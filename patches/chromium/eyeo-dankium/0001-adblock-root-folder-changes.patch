+# This is a vpython "spec" file.
+#
+# It describes patterns for python wheel dependencies of the python scripts in
+# the chromium repo, particularly for dependencies that have compiled components
+# (since pure-python dependencies can be easily vendored into third_party).
+#
+# When vpython is invoked, it finds this file and builds a python VirtualEnv,
+# containing all of the dependencies described in this file, fetching them from
+# CIPD (the "Chrome Infrastructure Package Deployer" service). Unlike `pip`,
+# this never requires the end-user machine to have a working python extension
+# compilation environment. All of these packages are built using:
+#   https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/main/infra/tools/dockerbuild/
+#
+# All python scripts in the repo share this same spec, to avoid dependency
+# fragmentation.
+#
+# If you have depot_tools installed in your $PATH, you can invoke python scripts
+# in this repo by running them as you normally would run them, except
+# substituting `vpython` instead of `python` on the command line, e.g.:
+#   vpython path/to/script.py some --arguments
+#
+# Read more about `vpython` and how to modify this file here:
+#   https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/main/doc/users/vpython.md
+#
+# For the definition of this spec, see:
+#   https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/main/vpython/api/vpython/spec.proto

+
+Eyeo Chromium SDK is a fork of the Chromium project that
+integrates ad-filtering capabilities.  A big part of the functionality is
+implemented inside a component, to simplify the integration with other
+modifications to the browser.
+
+The [component folder](components/adblock) contains most of the source code,
+as well as the changelog, license and technical documentation about
+architecture and integration steps.
