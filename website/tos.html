    <h1>Dankium - Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Dankium</strong>! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Dankium web browser software and any related services (collectively, the "Browser").</p>

    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Browser, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to these Terms, please don't download, install, or use the Browser.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. About Dankium</h2>
    <p>Dankium is a web browser I've built based on the open-source <strong>Chromium</strong> project. It's designed to give you a fast, secure, and user-friendly Browse experience. While Chromium is primarily developed by Google, Dankium is an independent distribution of the Chromium codebase.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Open Source License (GPLv3)</h2>
    <p>The core components of Dankium are distributed under the <strong>GNU General Public License, Version 3 ("GPLv3")</strong>. This means you're free to use, study, share, and modify the Browser software under the terms of the GPLv3.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can find a copy of the GPLv3 here: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html</a></li>
        <li>The source code for Dankium is available at: [Link to your source code repository, e.g., https://github.com/dankium/dankium]</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All included open-source components, including those from Eyeo GmbH and the Chromium project itself, are also licensed under the GPLv3 or a compatible open-source license.</strong> This ensures that all parts of the Browser derived from open-source contributions are subject to the same open-source principles.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Eyeo Integration</h2>
    <p>Dankium integrates services from third parties to enhance your Browse experience. This includes, but isn't limited to, content filtering services from Eyeo GmbH.</p>

    <h3>3.1. Eyeo Services (e.g., Adblock Plus functionality)</h3>
    <p>The Browser incorporates functionality developed by Eyeo GmbH, which may include features for blocking intrusive ads and tracking elements.</p>
    <p>While the <strong>code</strong> for these Eyeo features is GPLv3 licensed, your use of the <strong>service</strong> provided by Eyeo (e.g., specific filter lists that might be hosted or provided by Eyeo, or any cloud-based services they might offer) may still be subject to Eyeo's own terms and conditions and privacy policies. I strongly recommend you review these policies directly from Eyeo if you use any of their services beyond the local GPLv3 code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eyeo Terms of Service: <a href="[Link to Eyeo's official Terms of Service, e.g., https://adblockplus.org/terms]" target="_blank">[Link to Eyeo's official Terms of Service, e.g., https://adblockplus.org/terms]</a></li>
        <li>Eyeo Privacy Policy: <a href="[Link to Eyeo's official Privacy Policy, e.g., https://adblockplus.org/privacy]" target="_blank">[Link to Eyeo's official Privacy Policy, e.g., https://adblockplus.org/privacy]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of any third-party services, including any distinct services (not just the GPLv3 code) provided by Eyeo GmbH.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Google Services and Data (due to Chromium base)</h3>
    <p>As Dankium is built on the Chromium open-source project, it inherits certain functionalities and default behaviors from Chromium. This means that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Interaction with Google Services:</strong> When you use Dankium to visit Google-owned websites (e.g., Google Search, YouTube, Gmail), or websites that embed Google services (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Fonts, YouTube videos), your interactions with those services are governed by Google's own terms of service and privacy policies, just as they would be with any web browser. You can find Google's general terms here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/terms</a> and their Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Chromium Default Connections:</strong> Certain core Chromium components may, by default, make connections to Google servers for functions like Safe Browse (to check for malicious sites), fetching public key infrastructure updates, or checking for browser component updates. These connections are generally designed to be non-identifying to Google itself for the purpose of running Chromium, but my Privacy Policy (Section 5) will provide more details on any data handled by Dankium related to these connections.</li>
        <li><strong>No Proprietary Google Features:</strong> Dankium does <strong>not</strong> include proprietary Google services or features found in Google Chrome (e.g., Google Chrome Sync, Google Crash Reporting services, Widevine DRM, or licensed media codecs that are specific to Google Chrome) unless explicitly noted and integrated as separate, optional features within Dankium.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of Google's websites or services that you access *through* the browser.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Your Use of the Browser</h2>
    <h3>4.1. Permitted Use</h3>
    <p>You can use the Browser for your personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and the GPLv3.</p>

    <h3>4.2. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the Browser for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Browser or data contained within it.</li>
        <li>Try to gain unauthorized access to the Browser or its related systems or networks.</li>
        <li>Distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer the Browser, except as allowed by the GPLv3.</li>
        <li>Remove, alter, or hide any proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) from the Browser.</li>
        <li>Use the Browser to transmit any harmful, unlawful, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable material.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy matters to me. My Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://dankium.ca/privacy.html" target="_blank"><strong>https://dankium.ca/privacy.html</strong></a>, explains how I collect, use, and disclose information when you use the Browser. By using the Browser, you consent to my data practices as described in my Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Please remember that Eyeo's own privacy policy (linked in Section 3.1) and Google's general privacy policy (linked in Section 3.2) may still apply to your interactions with their respective services.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Updates and Modifications</h2>
    <p>I may, from time to time, provide updates, upgrades, patches, or other modifications to the Browser ("Updates"). These Updates might include bug fixes, new features, or security enhancements. You agree that I can automatically update the Browser on your device. You may not be able to opt out of receiving certain Updates.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE BROWSER IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, I DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES. I DON'T WARRANT THAT THE BROWSER WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL <strong>aroflcoppter</strong>, OR MY AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, OR PARTNERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE BROWSER; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE BROWSER; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE BROWSER; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT I'VE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless <strong>aroflcoppter</strong>, my affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (a) your use of and access to the Browser; (b) your violation of any term of these Terms; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (d) any claim that your use of the Browser caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Browser.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>I may terminate or suspend your access to the Browser immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Browser will immediately stop.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the <strong>Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    <p>You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within <strong>Newfoundland and Labrador</strong> to resolve any dispute arising out of these Terms or the Browser.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>12. General Provisions</h2>
    <h3>12.1. Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by me on the Browser, make up the entire agreement between you and <strong>aroflcoppter</strong> regarding the Browser.</p>

    <h3>12.2. Severability</h3>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain fully in effect.</p>

    <h3>12.3. Waiver</h3>
    <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms will be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and my failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms won't be a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

    <h3>12.4. Assignment</h3>
    <p>You can't transfer or assign these Terms, or any rights and licenses granted under them, but I can assign them without restriction.</p>
