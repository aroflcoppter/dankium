    <h1>Privacy Policy for Dankium Browser</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 13, 2025</p>

    <p>Hi there! This Privacy Policy explains how **Dankium Browser** ("Dankium" or "we") handles your information when you use our Chromium-based web browser. Dankium incorporates both **AdGuard DNS** for network-level filtering and **integrated content filters** that enhance your Browse experience.</p>
    <p>We're committed to being transparent about data and protecting your privacy. As a personal project, our goal is to provide a Browse experience that respects your data, not to collect it.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Dankium Browser is a personal project developed by **aroflcoppter**. You can reach us for privacy questions at **contact@dankium.ca**.</p>
    <p>Dankium is built on the open-source Chromium project and uses AdGuard DNS, along with its own integrated content filtering technology.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Data We Handle & How We Do It</h2>
    <p>Simply put, **we generally don't collect your personal Browse data.** Most of the information related to your Browse activity – like your history, bookmarks, and local storage – stays right on your device, under your control.</p>

    <h3>2.1. Dankium Browser-Specific Data (Managed by Dankium)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Your personal preferences, such as your default search engine, home page, and chosen theme, are stored locally on your device. If you decide to enable browser syncing (like Google Sync), your data will be managed according to that syncing service's privacy policy, not by Dankium.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address and User Agent (Local Processing):</strong> Your IP address is essential for your browser to connect to websites and services. Your User Agent string provides basic information about your browser and operating system to websites. This information is processed by your device and the websites you visit, but **we do not log or store your IP address or User Agent information on our servers for identification purposes.**</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Your Browse history, downloads, cookies, cache, saved passwords, and bookmarks are all stored locally on your device. **We do not access or store any of this information on our servers.**</li>
        <li><strong>Dankium Server Connections:</strong> Dankium Browser connects to our servers only for specific, limited purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>If you choose to view content from our website such as the `dankium.ca` homepage, license agreement, terms of service, or this privacy policy.</li>
                <li>To perform basic connectivity checks to ensure internet access.</li>
            </ul>
            During these connections, your IP address will be visible to our servers, but **we do not log or store your IP address or any other identifying information for these purposes.**
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Dankium's Integrated Content Filters</h3>
    <p>Dankium includes its own integrated content filtering mechanism designed to block unwanted ads, trackers, and malicious content directly within the browser. For these filters to remain effective, they periodically check for updates to their filtering rules (filter lists).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter List Updates:</strong> To ensure the integrated content filters are up-to-date, they periodically connect to `dankium.ca` servers to download the latest filter lists. During these updates, our servers receive non-personal technical information such as the Dankium Browser version and your operating system. Your browser's IP address will also be visible to our servers during this connection. **Crucially, no personal Browse data or your IP address is sent to `dankium.ca` for linking or identification purposes during this process.**</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Transmission:</strong> The integrated content filters operate on your device. **No personal data, Browse history, or information about the websites you visit is transmitted to `dankium.ca` or any third party to enable these filters.** They rely solely on the downloaded static filter lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. AdGuard DNS Data</h3>
    <p>Dankium uses **AdGuard DNS** as its default DNS (Domain Name System) resolver. This means that when your browser looks up a website address, it typically sends the request to AdGuard DNS servers to translate that address into an IP address. This helps enhance your privacy and provides a layer of protection by blocking ads, trackers, **malicious content (like malware and phishing sites)**, and other unwanted domains at the DNS level.</p>
    <p>When your browser connects to AdGuard DNS servers for resolution and to download content filters, your browser's IP address will be visible to AdGuard's servers. **As stated in AdGuard's Privacy Policy, AdGuard does not have the ability to match queries with an IP address.** **Dankium does not send any personal Browse data, specific website URLs, or identifying information to AdGuard DNS.** Your use of the AdGuard DNS service is subject to **AdGuard's own End User License Agreement (EULA) and Privacy Policy** (Note: Dankium Browser is licensed under AGPL 3.0). We strongly recommend you review these policies directly from AdGuard:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AdGuard DNS EULA: <a href="https://adguard-dns.io/en/eula.html" target="_blank">https://adguard-dns.io/en/eula.html</a></li>
        <li>AdGuard DNS Privacy Policy: <a href="https://adguard-dns.io/en/privacy.html" target="_blank">https://adguard-dns.io/en/privacy.html</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dankium is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of AdGuard DNS services.</p>

    <h3>2.4. Google Services and Data (due to Chromium base)</h3>
    <p>As Dankium is built on the Chromium open-source project, it inherits certain functionalities and default behaviors from Chromium. This means that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Interaction with Google Services:</strong> When you use Dankium to visit Google-owned websites (e.g., Google Search, YouTube, Gmail), or websites that embed Google services (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Fonts, YouTube videos), your interactions with those services are governed by Google's own terms of service and privacy policies, just as they would be with any web browser. **This includes, for instance, that search terms typed into the address bar or search bar may be sent to Google by default as you type for search suggestions or immediate search results.** You can find Google's general terms here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/terms</a> and their Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Chromium Default Connections (e.g., Component Updates):</strong> Certain core Chromium components may, by default, make connections to Google servers. These include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Component Updates:</strong> Chromium components (which are not Google Chrome features, but core browser parts) may check with Google servers for updates to ensure stability and security. This may involve sending basic browser information (like version and operating system) and your IP address.</li>
                <li><strong>No Proprietary Google Features:</strong> Dankium does **not** include proprietary Google services or features found in Google Chrome (e.g., Google Chrome Sync, Google Crash Reporting services, Widevine DRM, or licensed media codecs that are specific to Google Chrome) unless explicitly noted and integrated as separate, optional features within Dankium.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> Your browser may request access to your device's location data if a website or web application requests it and you grant permission. This location data is shared directly with the website/service you are using and is not collected or stored by Dankium on our servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dankium is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of Google's websites or services that you access <em>through</em> the browser, nor for how Google handles data from the default Chromium connections.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the very limited data we handle for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Keep Dankium Running:</strong> To ensure the browser works correctly, including its core features and the integrated AdGuard DNS.</li>
        <li><strong>To Make Dankium Better:</strong> To make improvements to its performance, stability, and features.</li>
        <li><strong>To Facilitate Chromium's Core Functionality:</strong> To enable essential features inherited from Chromium, such as component updates.</li>
        <li><strong>To Deliver Dankium Website Content:</strong> To provide you with content from `dankium.ca` such as the homepage, license agreement, terms of service, and this privacy policy, if you choose to view them.</li>
        <li><strong>To Ensure Connectivity:</strong> To perform basic checks to verify internet connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>To Update Integrated Content Filters:</strong> To allow Dankium's integrated content filters to receive necessary updates to their filter lists from `dankium.ca`.</li>
        <li><strong>To Help You When You Need It:</strong> If you contact us for support via email, we'll use the information you provide to assist you.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes, if ever required.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Data Interactions with Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Dankium Browser is designed to minimize data sharing. **We (the project developer) do not collect or share your personal Browse data.** However, for the browser to function effectively and provide its features, it makes direct connections to certain third-party services from your device. Information is transmitted directly between your browser and these services, as detailed below. Dankium (the project) does not act as an intermediary to collect or further share this information with other parties.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dankium Servers:</strong> Your browser connects directly to Dankium servers for displaying content from `dankium.ca` (e.g., homepage, license, terms of service, privacy policy), for connectivity checks, and for updating Dankium's integrated content filters. Your IP address is visible during these direct connections but is not logged or stored by us.</li>
        <li><strong>AdGuard DNS:</strong> When resolving website addresses or downloading content filters, your browser directly sends DNS queries to AdGuard DNS servers. Your IP address is visible to AdGuard during this direct connection. As stated in AdGuard's Privacy Policy, AdGuard does not have the ability to match queries with an IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Services (via Chromium):</strong> The underlying Chromium base may facilitate direct connections from your browser to Google servers for essential functionalities like component updates, and for search suggestions or immediate search results if you type into the address bar or search bar. Your IP address is visible to Google during these direct connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In rare cases, if legally compelled, we (the project developer) may be required to disclose information that you have voluntarily provided to us through direct communication (such as correspondence from email queries). This does not apply to your local Browse data, which we do not access or store.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event of a sale or transfer of Dankium or its assets, any limited information we directly possess (e.g., email support correspondence) might be transferred as part of that transaction, but only if the new owner agrees to follow this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You have significant control over your data within Dankium:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> You can control most of your browser settings directly within Dankium, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Clearing your Browse history, cookies, and cache.</li>
                <li>Managing site permissions (e.g., microphone, camera, location).</li>
                <li>Controlling third-party cookies.</li>
                <li>Managing saved passwords.</li>
                <li>Configuring various privacy and security settings.</li>
                <li>**Changing your default search engine or disabling search suggestions if you wish to limit data sent to Google from your address bar.**</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Content Filter Settings:</strong> You can manage settings related to Dankium's integrated content filters directly within the browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion:</strong> Since we don't collect personal Browse data, most of your data is on your device. You can access, correct, or delete this data directly through Dankium's settings. For any personal data you might have provided to us (e.g., via a support email), you have the right to request access, correction, or deletion in accordance with applicable laws. Please contact us using the details in Section 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the limited data we handle from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Most of your browser data (history, bookmarks, etc.) is stored locally on your device and stays there for as long as you choose to keep it.</p>
    <p>Information you provide for support inquiries via email is kept for a reasonable period to resolve your issue and for our records.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Dankium Browser is **not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from an individual under 18 without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We'll let you know about any significant changes by posting the updated policy within Dankium or on our project website, and by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
