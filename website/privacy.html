    <h1>Privacy Policy for Dankium Browser</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

    <p>Hi there! This Privacy Policy explains how **Dankium Browser** ("Dankium," "we," or "my personal project," referring to arofcoppter) handles your information when you use my Chromium-based web browser. Dankium incorporates content filtering and enhancement technologies from eyeo GmbH.</p>
    <p>We're committed to being transparent about data and protecting your privacy. As a personal project, our goal is to provide a Browse experience that respects your data, not to collect it.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Dankium Browser is a personal project developed by **aroflcoppter**. You can reach me for privacy questions at **contact@dankium.ca**.</p>
    <p>Dankium is built on the open-source Chromium project and uses content filtering technology provided by eyeo GmbH.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Data We Handle & How We Do It</h2>
    <p>Simply put, **we generally don't collect your personal Browse data.** Most of the information related to your Browse activity – like your history, bookmarks, and local storage – stays right on your device, under your control.</p>

    <h3>2.1. Dankium Browser-Specific Data (Managed by Dankium)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage and Performance Data (Optional Telemetry):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> If you choose to opt-in, we might collect **anonymous, aggregated telemetry data** to understand how Dankium performs and is generally used. This could include things like crash reports (without personal identifiers), how often certain features are used (e.g., if a specific menu item is clicked), and general performance metrics (like how fast the browser starts). This data is designed to be completely non-identifiable and **never includes your Browse history, search queries, or personal content.**</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> This data is collected using an anonymous identifier and is always aggregated. You can **opt-out of this collection at any time** in Dankium's settings under **[Settings Path, e.g., "Privacy and security" > "Usage statistics"]**.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Your personal preferences, such as your default search engine, home page, and chosen theme, are stored locally on your device. If you decide to enable browser syncing (like Google Sync), your data will be managed according to that syncing service's privacy policy, not by Dankium.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address and User Agent (Local Processing):</strong> Your IP address is essential for your browser to connect to websites and services. Your User Agent string provides basic information about your browser and operating system to websites. This information is processed by your device and the websites you visit, but **we do not log or store your IP address or User Agent information on our servers for identification purposes.**</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Your Browse history, downloads, cookies, cache, saved passwords, and bookmarks are all stored locally on your device. **We do not access or store any of this information on our servers.**</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Eyeo-Specific Data (Handled by eyeo's components within Dankium)</h3>
    <p>The eyeo components (like the technology behind Adblock Plus) integrated into Dankium work primarily on your device. Their purpose is to improve your Browse experience by filtering unwanted content.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter List Updates:</strong> For eyeo's components to work effectively, they periodically check for updates to their content filtering rules (filter lists) from eyeo's servers. This check includes non-personal technical info like the Dankium Browser version, the eyeo component version, and your operating system. Your browser's IP address will be visible to eyeo's servers during this connection. **No personal Browse data or your IP address is sent to eyeo for linking or identification purposes during this process.**</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptable Ads (Optional):</strong> If you've enabled the "Acceptable Ads" feature (which is opt-out and enabled by default in the eyeo component), it will apply specific rules to allow certain non-intrusive ads.
            <ul>
                <li>**Crucially, no personal data, Browse history, or information about the websites you visit is transmitted to eyeo or any third party to enable "Acceptable Ads."** This feature relies entirely on static filter lists. You can disable "Acceptable Ads" at any time in Dankium's eyeo component settings.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Statistics (for eyeo components):</strong> The eyeo components may collect **anonymous and aggregated** statistics about their own usage to improve their functionality and performance. This could include, for example, the total number of blocked requests, how often filter lists are updated, or the performance of the filtering engine. This data is **completely anonymous and cannot be linked back to you or your Browse activity.** You can opt-out of this collection within the eyeo component settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Issue Reporting:</strong> If you choose to voluntarily submit a report about a broken website or an unblocked ad, you might be asked to provide certain technical information (e.g., the URL, a screenshot). This submission is completely voluntary, and you should make sure no personal information is included unless you explicitly want to provide it. This data is used solely to help fix the reported issue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. Google Services and Data (due to Chromium base)</h3>
    <p>As Dankium is built on the Chromium open-source project, it inherits certain functionalities and default behaviors from Chromium. This means that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Interaction with Google Services:</strong> When you use Dankium to visit Google-owned websites (e.g., Google Search, YouTube, Gmail), or websites that embed Google services (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Fonts, YouTube videos), your interactions with those services are governed by Google's own terms of service and privacy policies, just as they would be with any web browser. You can find Google's general terms here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/terms</a> and their Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Chromium Default Connections (e.g., Safe Browse, Component Updates):</strong> Certain core Chromium components may, by default, make connections to Google servers. These include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safe Browse:</strong> To protect you from malicious websites and downloads, Chromium periodically checks URLs against Google's lists of unsafe web resources. This involves sending partial hashes of URLs to Google. If a potential match occurs, the full URL may be sent to Google for verification. Your browser's IP address will be visible during these connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Component Updates:</strong> Chromium components (which are not Google Chrome features, but core browser parts) may check with Google servers for updates to ensure stability and security. This may involve sending basic browser information (like version and operating system) and your IP address.</li>
                <li><strong>No Proprietary Google Features:</strong> Dankium does **not** include proprietary Google services or features found in Google Chrome (e.g., Google Chrome Sync, Google Crash Reporting services, Widevine DRM, or licensed media codecs that are specific to Google Chrome) unless explicitly noted and integrated as separate, optional features within Dankium.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> Your browser may request access to your device's location data if a website or web application requests it and you grant permission. This location data is shared directly with the website/service you are using and is not collected or stored by Dankium on our servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dankium is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of Google's websites or services that you access <em>through</em> the browser, nor for how Google handles data from the default Chromium connections.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the very limited data we handle for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Keep Dankium Running:</strong> To ensure the browser works correctly, including its core features and the integrated eyeo technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>To Make Dankium Better:</strong> To understand how the browser is used (through optional, anonymous telemetry) and make improvements to its performance, stability, and features.</li>
        <li><strong>To Update eyeo's Technologies:</strong> To allow the eyeo components to receive necessary updates to their filter lists.</li>
        <li><strong>To Facilitate Chromium's Core Functionality:</strong> To enable essential features inherited from Chromium, such as Safe Browse and component updates.</li>
        <li><strong>To Help You When You Need It:</strong> If you contact us for support, we'll use the information you provide to assist you.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes, if ever required.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Data</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep data sharing to an an absolute minimum.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With eyeo GmbH:</strong> We share the non-personal, technical data necessary for eyeo's components to function and update, as described in Section 2.2 (e.g., Dankium Browser version, eyeo component version, OS, and your IP address visible during connection). **eyeo GmbH does not receive your personal Browse history or identifiable personal data from your use of Dankium for linking or identification purposes.**</li>
        <li><strong>With Google (via Chromium):</strong> As detailed in Section 2.3, certain data (e.g., partial URL hashes for Safe Browse, basic browser info for component updates, and your IP address during connection) may be sent to Google servers by the underlying Chromium components. This is for security and browser functionality and is handled by Google according to their policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We might use third-party services (e.g., analytics services for anonymous usage data if you opt-in for telemetry, crash reporting services). These providers are legally bound to protect your data and only use it for the purposes it was provided.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights or property, or ensure the safety of users or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event of a sale or transfer of Dankium or its assets, your information might be transferred as part of that transaction, but only if the new owner agrees to follow this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate and Anonymized Data:</strong> We might share aggregated or anonymized data that cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for research or other purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You have significant control over your data within Dankium:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Eyeo Component Settings:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acceptable Ads:</strong> You can disable "Acceptable Ads" in the eyeo component settings within Dankium.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Statistics (eyeo):</strong> You can disable the collection of anonymous usage statistics by eyeo components in their respective settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter Lists:</strong> You can manage and disable specific filter lists within the eyeo component settings.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> You can control most of your browser settings directly within Dankium, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Clearing your Browse history, cookies, and cache.</li>
                <li>Managing site permissions (e.g., microphone, camera, location).</li>
                <li>Controlling third-party cookies.</li>
                <li>Managing saved passwords.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion:</strong> Since we don't collect personal Browse data, most of your data is on your device. You can access, correct, or delete this data directly through Dankium's settings. For any personal data you might have provided to us (e.g., via a support email), you have the right to request access, correction, or deletion in accordance with applicable laws. Please contact me using the details in Section 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the limited data we handle from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Most of your browser data (history, bookmarks, etc.) is stored locally on your device and stays there for as long as you choose to keep it.</p>
    <p>Any anonymous telemetry data we collect (if you opt-in) is kept only as long as needed for analytical purposes, typically for **up to 26 months**, and then securely deleted.</p>
    <p>Information you provide for support inquiries is kept for a reasonable period to resolve your issue and for our records.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Dankium Browser is **not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from an individual under 18 without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We'll let you know about any significant changes by posting the updated policy within Dankium or on our project website, and by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
